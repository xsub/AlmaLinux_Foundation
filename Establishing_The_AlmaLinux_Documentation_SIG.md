# **Establishing the AlmaLinux Documentation SIG**

> The AlmaLinux Special Interest Group (SIG) aims to create high-quality documentation for the AlmaLinux OS, an open-source, community-driven RHEL fork. By examining strategies from successful projects like CentOS and Fedora, we can establish a strong foundation for the AlmaLinux Documentation SIG.

### 1. Defining Clear Goals and Scope as “Clear objectives ensure a focused effort”. 

 * Work to refine the [AlmaLinux Marketing Targets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVpNuRFHiXLf5IjnWt1m4Lymo9Vt3iftdHxoFKOf9Tk/edit?usp=sharing), content types, and objectives.  
 * Create a collaboratively built [The AlmaLinux Handbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jVpNuRFHiXLf5IjnWt1m4Lymo9Vt3iftdHxoFKOf9Tk/edit?usp=sharing)  with smaller pieces dedicated to selected RHEL/AlmaLinux technologies or aspects.. 

### 2. Adopting a Collaborative Infrastructure: 
 
* Our website is Hugo-based with sources on GitHub, already establishing a solid foundation for AlmaLinux contributions to Wiki pages, Howtos and HandBook. 
* We need to consider creating a dedicated mailing list or using a dedicated chat channel for communication, in addition to Git for collaboration. 

### 3. Developing a Contributor's Guide: 
 
*  Create a comprehensive guide to streamline documentation processes, ensure consistency, and help new contributors. Include style guidelines, markup conventions, submission processes, and localization best practices. 
*  Make it accessible to all potential contributors.

[Elevate Contribution Guide](https://wiki.almalinux.org/elevate/Contribution-guide.html) is to be completely reworked. 
This needs defining requirements first than we can estimate time/effort. 

### 4. Fostering a Supportive Community: Build a strong contributor community by offering support and mentorship, recognizing member efforts, and facilitating knowledge sharing.

* Testable documentation, such as how-tos, with openQA encourages contributors to progress further, prepare tests, and potentially add more scenarios to the handbook or write code.
* Engage with the broader AlmaLinux community to raise awareness and attract more contributors.
* Reach out to industry leaders: technical coaches and educators and ask them to create under auspices of The AlmaLinux Foundation.

### 5. Establishing a Review and Quality Assurance Process: Implement a structured review process to ensure accuracy, clarity, and consistency of documentation.
 
* Select and name foundation and community reviewers, enabling certain individuals from the community to be responsible for specific parts of the handbook by establishing Github groups. 
* Involve peer reviews, subject matter expert reviews, quality assurance teams.
