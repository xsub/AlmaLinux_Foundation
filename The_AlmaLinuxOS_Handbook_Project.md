# The AlmaLinux Handbook Project

## Why is having a comprehensive and well-documented handbook** important for the popularity of an open-source, community-driven, enterprise community-driven enterprise Linux distribution?

** like Fedora_Handbook or Gentoo_Handbook or FreeBSD Handbook

- Ease of use: A well-written handbook can provide users with clear and concise instructions on installing, configuring, and using the AlmaLinux distribution. A manual written in such a way can help users overcome any initial barriers to entry and make it easier for them to get started with the distribution.

- Community support: A handbook can also serve as a centralized resource for the community to share knowledge and support one another. By documenting common issues and their solutions, users can help each other troubleshoot problems and find answers to their questions.

- Standardization: A handbook can help to standardize the installation and configuration process across different hardware and software configurations. A properly written manual can help reduce variability in the user experience and make it easier for users to share their experiences and collaborate.

- Trust: A well-documented handbook can help build trust with users and potential users by demonstrating a commitment to transparency and user empowerment. Such an approach can help to establish the AlmaLinux distribution as a reliable and trustworthy option within the open-source community.

## What Foundation goals it aligns with?

- The AlmaLinus Handbook can be used for building an ecosystem to educate users and potential users on using the distribution for modern computing within various environments.

### Foundation for others

Comprehensive and well-documented end-user documentation for AlmaLinux can be a foundation for other Linux-based solutions by offering a standardized and reliable platform for building and deploying new systems and applications. This documentation assists users in efficiently configuring and managing their systems, simplifying the process of creating custom solutions on top of AlmaLinux, and minimizing the time and effort needed for deploying new solutions.

### Community development

Alongside the handbook, focusing on a broader ecosystem of documentation, tutorials, and forums can assist users of all experience levels get the most out of AlmaLinux as an "RHEL (RedHat Linux) clone." Our approach involves staging new handbook sections as a 'how-to' series and integrating them into the relevant handbook branches. Such a handbook fosters a sense of community and support among users, helping to cultivate a vibrant ecosystem around the distribution. For instance, the FreeBSD handbook features a direct "edit this page" link to the GitHub repository, enabling immediate and close collaboration on documentation. While we have a GitHub repository, establishing a similar large-scale goal is essential.

### HPC content rationale

The handbook serves as a crucial resource for guiding new Linux users through installation and configuration processes while familiarizing them with the basics of the Linux operating system. Furthermore, it can offer detailed instructions for installing and configuring software applications and tools frequently used in scientific and HPC environments. Some have suggested a dedicated HPC wiki; if a wiki is necessary, comprehensive documentation is even more critical. We aim to encourage knowledgeable administrators from prominent scientific and business organizations to share their expertise more broadly rather than limiting it to a closed circle of like-minded experts.

### Enterprise Content vs. Wiki Series

The AlmaLinux Handbook guides users in setting up and managing critical infrastructure services in enterprise settings. These services include databases, web servers, and file-sharing systems with high-volume data traffic and high-availability requirements. Additionally, the handbook can incorporate best practices for security management and regulatory compliance.

Our "Nginx-" and "Security Basics-" series are just the beginning of building step-by-step, piece-by-piece. We're adding a new "Series" section to the wiki to support ongoing development and populating it with content. Our ultimate goal is to integrate this content into the Handbook, section by section.

While we are starting with low-hanging fruit, our long-term objective is to build knowledge from environments ranging from Raspberry Pi home DIY projects to large-scale, enterprise installations in exa-scale corporations and leading research facilities around the world.

We are also launching the AlmaLinux Podcast to complement the Handbook and Wiki. Our podcast will feature interviews with interesting guests from the industry who will share real-life use cases and insights to inspire users and contributors to create new sections or extend the handbook.

### Comparison: Differences between Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD
Why/What?

Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD are three open-source operating systems that have gained popularity in the open-source community. One of the significant factors contributing to the success of these projects is the presence of comprehensive and well-documented handbooks. Here are some examples of how having a handbook has helped these projects gain popularity and the potential differences between them:

 -  Ease of Use: Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD handbooks provide clear and concise instructions for installing and configuring the operating systems, as well as setting up various applications and services. Such an approach has helped new users get up and running quickly and has made it easier for experienced users to configure their systems to meet their needs.

    Potential Differences: Fedora is often considered user-friendly, with a straightforward installation process and package management. FreeBSD offers a stable and reliable environment focusing on performance, while Gentoo is known for its high customizability and requires more advanced technical skills for setup and maintenance.

 -  Community Support: The Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD handbooks have served as central resources for their communities to share knowledge and support one another; and have helped build strong and supportive communities, attracting more users to the respective operating systems.

    Potential Differences: The Fedora community is known for being supportive and welcoming to new users, making it an excellent option for those just starting with open-source operating systems. The Gentoo community is known for being more technical and focused on customization, while the FreeBSD community focuses on stability, performance, and reliability.

 -  Standardization: Handbooks for Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD have helped standardize the installation and configuration process, making it easier for users to share their experiences and collaborate, and have contributed to building communities around these operating systems, which in turn has increased their popularity.

    Potential Differences: Fedora strongly focuses on innovation and cutting-edge features, while FreeBSD prioritizes stability and performance. Gentoo, on the other hand, emphasizes customization and user choice in configuring their system.

 -  Trust: The Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD handbooks have helped build trust with users and potential users by demonstrating a commitment to transparency and user empowerment; and have established these operating systems as reliable and trustworthy options in the open-source community.

    Potential Differences: Fedora, backed by Red Hat, strongly focuses on open-source innovation, while FreeBSD is known for its robust and stable environment. Gentoo focuses on its community-driven development process and extensive customization options.

### Conclusion

Having comprehensive and well-documented handbooks has played a significant role in the success of Fedora, Gentoo, and FreeBSD. While there are differences between these projects, these handbooks have helped make these operating systems more accessible, standardized, and trustworthy for users.
